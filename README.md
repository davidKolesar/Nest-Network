# Nest-Network

December 20117

Nest Network is a JavaScript chat client hosted by Scaledrone messaging service. It was created so that people in our household could communicate over the network without installing third party software or relying on cell phones. When logging into the home wifi network, this page is the splash screen. The github version connects to a special room created specifically for github, while the household network connects to a different room.
